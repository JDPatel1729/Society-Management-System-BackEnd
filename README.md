# Society-Management-System-BackEnd

I worked on this project with one my dear friend OM Patel. He created the client-side part this project in React. I built the server-side part and used Django Rest Framework for the API's. This was the first project we came across a term called "CORS". It was kind of a hurdel for us. But eventually we solved it. So,over and all yeahhh! The Client Side can be found at https://github.com/omp2020/sms so do have a look. React App is hosted on Firebase and Django is hosted on a AWS EC2 Instance.
